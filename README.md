# LOE CORE

Contains the base code for interactions with LOE database and file file system.

## Setup

Assumes the existence of a mysql database named

```
LOE
```

With tables:

```
anime
comics
docs
movies
music
tv
```

Connection details can be modified in:

```
Libs/Record/Db/credentials.php
```

Expects LOE file system be be mounted at webroot.
Default webroot, is

```
/var/www/html
```

defined in

```
./LoeBase.php
LoeBase::WEBROOT
```

### Structure

Libs/ -- required submodules

 * [./Libs/MessageClient/MessageClient](https://github.com/outlawdesigns-io/MessageClient) - used to email reports generated by Scanner classes
 * [./Libs/Mp3Reader/Mp3Reader](https://github.com/outlawdesigns-io/Mp3Reader) -   required for a \LOE\Song to be able to read the ID3 tags associated with its file_path
 * [./Libs/Record/Record](https://github.com/outlawdesigns-io/Record) - Extended to create \LOE\LoeBase which is extended to create domain objects

Models/ -- domain objects concrete classes

scanners/ -- classes that verify data and produce reports, but do not change the state of any data

processors/ -- classes that verify data and attempt, in some way, to change to state of that data



## Usage

```
require_once __DIR__ . '/factory.php';

//initialize an empty domain object

$movie = LoeFactory::create('movies');

$movie->title = 'Titanic';

//initialize an existing domain object

$song = LoeFactory::create('music',6661);
print_r($song);

```
